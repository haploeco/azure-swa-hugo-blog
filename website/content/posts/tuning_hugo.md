## Introduction

One of the best things I like about Hugo is how easy it is to setup and automate. For example, this blog is deployed on merge to main branch on GitHub via Github Actions. It ends up running in Azure serverless. No servers to manage, no databases to patch, just write markdown and push to git.

Now that I am trying use it more seriously, I am working with AI to figure out ways to make my workflow even easier. Here are some of the things I am exploring.
## Key Points
1. **Using Archetypes to Standardize Content Creation**: Hugo's archetypes allow you to create templates for different types of content. By defining archetypes for blog posts, project pages, or documentation, you can streamline the content creation process and ensure consistency across your site. In the past, I have struggled with trying to keep things consistent by keeping everything in my head, but then I found I wouldn't write things due to the cognitive load. Archetypes help reduce that load.
2. **Automating Metadata with Front Matter Defaults** Having the default settings I would like to have in every post set is a huge time saver. With the templates, it fills in the defaults that I want, and I can update them as needed when writing content.
3. **Building Custom Layouts for the Optimal Look ant Feel**: Hugo's templating system allows you to create custom layouts for your content. By designing layouts that suit your specific needs, you can enhance the visual appeal and usability of your site. This is especially useful for showcasing projects or portfolios where a unique presentation is beneficial.

## Takeaways
By leveraging Hugo's features such as archetypes, front matter defaults, and custom layouts, you can significantly enhance your content creation workflow. These tools not only save time but also help maintain consistency and improve the overall quality of your website. As I continue to explore these options, I look forward to discovering even more ways to optimize my use of Hugo for content management.
