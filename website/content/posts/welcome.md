# Welcome

As I attempt to figure out how I want to create a workflow with hugo, you will likely see some pretty boring content getting posted here. Fear not, the real content will likely be just as boring!

## Static Site Generators

I am actually pretty excited to be getting hugo setup with CI/CD deployment so that I can ease my workflow. I use vimwiki and taskwiki in neovim for almost all of my note-taking, and using hugo with markdown makes it so that I can likely post pretty much any documentation and howtos that I do for myself without any additional effort. 

In other words, I don't have any more excuses....

## Images

I am going to run through a few hugo docs to figure out how I want to get a bit more power into my posts. I am guessing that most of it I will do via standard markdown, and perhaps host my image content in some object storage somewhere. Whatever I decide to do, the goal is cheap, fast, and easy and I WILL choose all three ;)
