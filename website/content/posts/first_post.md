# First Post - Let's do this!

This has a bit of content for us to look at!

## How did we get here?

I used Ned in the Cloud's post on how to deploy Hugo to Azure with Github Actions to deploy this site.

## What do I need to do next?

I would like to start with keeping a simple blog, and this might be a good way to do it.

1. Start thinking of content that I would like to post.
2. Use a repo like this (or perhaps this one???) to publish the content.
3. Profit!
