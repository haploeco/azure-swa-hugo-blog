# Thoughs about Notion

I have heard a lot of people talking about notion and how they like it, so I thought that I might give it a go. I wanted to toss out a few of my initial impressions.

### Ease of use
 
First off, the ease of using the platform sticks out to me. Everything is very intuitive, and I find it easy to start creating immediately. This is extremely helpful when you just need to get some content out there!

### Security

With this ease of adding content comes my biggest fear. Security. Notion does not claim to do full end-to-end encryption. They encrypt at rest, and they encrypt in transit, but in order to use some of their features like full-text searching, they have opted to not have a completely user private key driven service. This means that their employees have the potential to view your data. They are legally obligated to only access your data when you have been engaged as a customer, but it still leaves the door open. My biggest fears tend to be less around an unscrupulous employee, and more about a bad guy gaining access to the their system.
