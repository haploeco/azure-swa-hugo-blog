## What to contact me about

I’m especially interested in hearing about:

- Real-world experiences with Linux, cloud, and security in complex environments
- Stories about homelab setups, good and bad
- Questions or suggestions related to posts on this site
- Ideas for topics you’d like to see explored in more depth

I can’t promise a response to every message, but I do read what comes in and use it to guide future posts.

## A quick note on privacy

If you email me, I’ll treat your message as private and won’t publish details without your explicit permission. If I ever reference a conversation in a post, it will be anonymized unless we’ve agreed otherwise.
