    Hi, I’m {{ with .Site.Params.name }}{{ . }}{{ else }}a systems architect{{

  </h2>
  <p>
    I spend my time designing and operating systems that don’t fall over when
    things get weird: Linux everywhere, security by default, and cloud
    architectures that are boring in all the right ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    Natet.io is my little corner of the internet for experiments, notes, and the
    occasional deep dive into how modern infrastructure actually works.

  <h2>What I’m into</h2>
  <p>On any given day you’ll probably find me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hardening Linux systems and tuning them for real workloads.</li>
    <li>
      Designing cloud architectures that balance security, reliability, and
      developer sanity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automating everything with Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      Exploring security controls, threat models, and how they apply to real
      orgs—not just slide decks.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Over time, this site will collect write-ups, diagrams, and small tools that
    I’ve found useful.

  <h2>Where to find more</h2>
  <p>
    This site is still early days. Eventually you’ll find posts, notes, and
    maybe a small portfolio of projects here. For now, you can think of it as a
    landing page that says:
    <em>“Yes, Natet is absolutely still hacking on things.”</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re into Linux, cloud, security, or IT architecture, you’ll probably
    feel at home.
